**Welcome to the Europa demo!**

Europa is an image-rich custom website for a fictitious art museum.

This guide is here to offer a tour of the build.

## Every Craft Site is a Custom Site

Craft’s greatest strength makes it challenging to demo: it’s an empty canvas.

If we started with a fresh install there wouldn’t be much to see, because you’re in charge of how you shape your content and however you choose to build the front end.

We know you’re probably not looking to build a website for a fake art musuem, so we’ll highlight the Craft features you could use to build just about any kind of site.

## Front End

The front end is the public-facing part of the site, as opposed to the Craft CMS control panel you’re in now.

You can jump straight to [the front end]({{ siteUrl }}) from anywhere in the Craft control panel by clicking **Europa Museum** above the main navigation:

![]({{ alias('@assetBaseUrl/assets/guide/site-link.png') }})

The front end is built with Twig, Craft’s native templating system, with modern Sass and JavaScript. It features [exhibitions](/exhibitions), [news posts](/news), and one-off pages you’d expect like [home](/), [about](/about), [visiting information](/visit) and a [contact page]({{ siteUrl('contact') }}). Each page uses its own custom layout.

You may want to browse around the front end to get a feel for it. Your site would inevitably look different and may be built with different tools, so we’ll focus our tour primarily on the Craft CMS control panel.

## Control Panel

You’ve clearly made it to the control panel, which is where developers configure your content model and everyone manages content day to day.

Before we go any further, you may want to visit your [account preferences]({{ cpUrl('myaccount#prefs') }}) to make the control panel a little more comfortable. Select the profile menu in the top right corner and click your username. Your **Preferences** tab includes language, formatting and accessibility options that might improve your demo experience:

![]({{ alias('@assetBaseUrl/assets/guide/my-account.png') }})

You’re looking at a current version of Craft CMS Pro with a minimal set of plugins since we want to emphasize what Craft does out of the box.

The main navigation is off to your left, and depending on your browser width you may need to press the menu button to expand it.


You’re looking at the Craft control panel as an admin so we can see everything all at once; this is the kitchen-sink view:

![]({{ alias('@assetBaseUrl/assets/guide/dashboard.png') }})

Normally we wouldn’t see **Settings** or **Plugin Store** in production, and each user would see only the things allowed by the [permissions groups]({{ cpUrl('settings/users') }}) you’ve created and assigned.
