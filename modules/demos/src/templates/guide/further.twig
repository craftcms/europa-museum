{% set intro %}
Now that we’ve looked at Craft’s content modeling and editing, let’s zoom out and look at the broader landscape: how we manage users, how you can get content out of Craft, and how plugins can add functionality to your site.
{% endset %}

{% set content %}
## GraphQL

![]({{ alias('@assetBaseUrl/assets/guide/graphiql.png') }})

Craft Pro includes a full GraphQL API for exposing all its content for an external system or front end. This self-documenting API can be ideal for developers to quickly find, read and write whatever they need for the system they’re working with.

Developers can set up as many [schemas]({{ cpUrl('graphql/schemas') }}) and [tokens]({{ cpUrl('graphql/tokens') }}) as they need, and jump straight into the included [GraphiQL]({{ cpUrl('graphiql') }}) interface to interactively explore the API.

## Plugins

![]({{ alias('@assetBaseUrl/assets/guide/plugins.png') }})

Craft’s included [plugin store]({{ cpUrl('plugin-store') }}) features hundreds of first- and third-party plugins that add functionality to Craft CMS.

### SEOmatic

Europa uses [SEOmatic](https://plugins.craftcms.com/seomatic), a paid commercial plugin, to handle a vast number of search engine optimization concerns with a limited amount of initial configuration.

### Freeform

Europa’s contact form is managed by [Freeform](https://plugins.craftcms.com/freeform), another popular commercial plugin that makes it easy to build forms, collect and browse submissions, and customize email notifications.

### Custom Plugins & Modules

Craft’s extensive developer APIs and documentation mean developers can—and often do—build their own [custom plugins and modules](https://craftcms.com/docs/3.x/extend/) to add specific functionality to a site.

## What Next?

There’s lots more to cover, and we recommend that developers consider checking out the [documentation](https://craftcms.com/docs/) and [getting started tutorial](https://craftcms.com/docs/getting-started-tutorial/) that takes a hands-on approach to setting up a local environment and building a simple blog from scratch.

To get the most out of your demo and get a good feel for Craft, consider creating fields and sections and modeling your content if you have a specific project in mind. There’s no better way to see how Craft might be useful _for you_.

If you’re planning an ecommerce project, consider trying our Spoke & Chain demo at [craftcms.com](https://craftcms.com/demo) that showcases [Craft Commerce](https://craftcms.com/commerce), our first-party ecommerce plugin that brings Craft’s flexibility to bespoke online stores.
